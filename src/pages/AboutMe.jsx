        <p>
          My name is Steven Bunde and I am very excited to become a software
          developer! I have spent my professional career in the strength and
          conditioning industry training athletes and adults. It has always been
          a passion of mine to help clients achieve their goals no matter what
          they are. I am hoping to take the experience I have had serving my
          clients to the technology industry. I am looking for a new challenge
          and to become a more rounded professional. My reasoning for switching
          to this industry is that I have a passion for learning how things
          work. I began my education in understanding human anatomy and
          physiology and have now shifted my focus to computer science. I am
          excited to take on this new challenge and I can not wait to see what
          my future career holds. Learning how computer systems operate and how
          applications are made has always been a skill I have wanted to
          understand. I am hoping to one day merge my knowledge of strength and
          conditioning and software development to create an application that
          helps people live a happy and healthy life.{' '}
